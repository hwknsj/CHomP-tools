# CHomP-tools
A set of tools used in my undergraduate thesis to perform batch cubical homology
using with CHomP by Shaun Harker and analyze the data.

The scripts cubicalHom.py, greyGrid.py, and diffGrey.py utilize CHomP.
The other scripts aid with data analysis. In particular, entropy.py
calculates the Shannon entropy given a time series of Betti Numbers.
